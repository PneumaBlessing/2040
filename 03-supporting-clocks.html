                <h1>3. The Supporting Clocks</h1>

                <h2>The Prophetic Durations: The Architectural Beams of the Timeline</h2>
                <p>If the Priestly Courses are the engine's gears and the Jubilee Cycle is its master clock, then the great prophetic durations are its unbreakable, architectural support beams. These are not vague predictions; they are precise, quantifiable, and interlocking blocks of time that give the entire biblical timeline its rigid, unshakeable structure. The Unified Chronology is the only model in history that honors the mathematical precision of these three crucial prophecies.</p>

                <h2>Support Beam #1: The 390 Years of Ezekiel 4</h2>
                <p><strong>The Prophecy:</strong> The 390-year period of Israel's "iniquity" (Ezekiel 4) is a literal, architectural duration.</p>

                <p><strong>The Unified Chronology's Vindication:</strong> The UC protocol honors this biblical data as supreme. This period begins at the start of the Divided Kingdom (919 BC) and culminates in the destruction of the Temple (530 BC). This single, textually-faithful decision is the key that unlocks the entire period of the Kings and eliminates the need for any speculative co-regencies.</p>

                <h2>Support Beam #2: The 70-Year Exile</h2>
                <p><strong>The Prophecy:</strong> The prophet Jeremiah declares that the desolation of Jerusalem and the servitude to Babylon will last for 70 years (Jeremiah 25:11, 29:10).</p>

                <p><strong>The High-Precision Anchor:</strong> In the Unified Chronology, this 70-year period is a high-precision beam. It is not just a block of 70 solar years; it is a period of 70 Tishri-to-Tishri prophetic years.</p>

                <p><strong>Start Point:</strong> The destruction of the First Temple in the 5th month (Av) of 530 BC. Per the Talmud, this destruction occurred in the outgoing of a Sabbatical year. This means that the first prophetic year of the exile would begin just two months later, in Tishri of 530 BC, marking the 1st year of the exile and the start of a new Sabbatical cycle.</p>

                <p><strong>End Point:</strong> The completion and dedication of the Second Temple in the 12th month (Adar) of Darius I's 6th year (Ezra 6:15).</p>

                <p><strong>The Lock:</strong> For the 70-year prophecy to be fulfilled with perfect precision, the dedication must occur exactly 70 prophetic years from the start. A 70-year countdown from the start of the exile in Tishri, 530 BC, brings us to Tishri, 460 BC. The dedication of the Temple in Adar (the 12th month) of the civil year 460 BC falls perfectly within this final, 70th year.</p>

                <p><strong>The "Double Witness" - The Jubilee Correlation:</strong> This is the profound, hidden confirmation. The 70-year exile does not end on a random date; it ends with an event of immense theological significance. The prophetic year that begins in Tishri, 460 BC, is not just the 70th year of the exile's end; it is also the year of the 70th Jubilee since Creation. This is a stunning, multi-layered alignment. The 70 years of punishment are directly and thematically followed by the restorative celebration of the 70th Jubilee, proving the entire timeline is a single, divinely-authored narrative.</p>

                <h2>Support Beam #3: The 490 Years of Daniel 9</h2>
                <p><strong>The Prophecy:</strong> The angel Gabriel declares that a 490-year countdown ("Seventy weeks") begins from the "commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem."</p>

                <p><strong>The Grand Synthesis (The Final, Perfected Lock):</strong> This is the final, triumphant lock. The 490-year prophecy is the divine "Remedy" that begins precisely at the moment the 70-year "Penalty" and its corresponding Jubilee celebration commence.</p>

                <p><strong>The True "Commandment":</strong> The "commandment" finds its ultimate fulfillment at the start of the great, restorative 70th Jubilee year, which begins in Tishri of 460 BC. This is the anchor that starts the 490-year clock.</p>

                <p><strong>The Unassailable Prediction:</strong> Now, we perform the final, definitive calculation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start Date: Tishri, 460 BC (The 70th Jubilee)</li>
                    <li>Duration: 490 years</li>
                    <li>End Date: A 490-year prophetic clock starting in 460 BC culminates in the prophetic year of 31 AD</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The Result:</strong> The 490-year prophecy, when anchored to the 70th Jubilee, points with stunning, year-level precision to 31 AD, the very year of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ in the Unified Chronology.</p>

                <h2>The Inescapable Conclusion</h2>
                <p>These are not three separate prophecies. They are a perfectly interlocking, multi-layered, and thematically coherent divine machine, all calibrated to the Tishri-based prophetic calendar and the Jubilee cycle. A 390-year period of iniquity is followed by a 70-year period of punishment, which culminates in the 70th Jubilee, which in turn starts the 490-year clock of restoration that points directly to the Cross.</p>

                <p>The Unified Chronology is the only system that reveals this perfect, breathtaking mathematical and theological architecture.</p>
