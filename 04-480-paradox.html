                <h1>4. The 480-Year Paradox Solved</h1>
                
                <h2>Validating 1 Kings 6:1 - The 490-Year Prophetic Bridge</h2>
                <p>For centuries, the single verse of 1 Kings 6:1 has been one of the most contentious in biblical chronology. It is the Bible's most explicit long-range chronological statement, a "golden beam" intended to connect the era of the Kings to the era of the Exodus. Yet, it has been a source of paradox. The Unified Chronology now proves that this verse is not a paradox; it is a statement of stunning, multi-layered prophetic and mathematical truth.</p>
                
                <p>The verse states:</p>
                
                <p><em>"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign... he began to build the house of the LORD."</em></p>

                <h2>The High-Precision Anchors of the Unified Chronology</h2>
                <p>To solve this, we must first establish our two unshakeable, Jubilee-calibrated anchors with the full precision of the prophetic Tishri-to-Tishri calendar.</p>
                
                <h3>The Jordan Crossing Anchor (The 50th Jubilee)</h3>
                <p>The 40-year wandering in the wilderness concludes after the Exodus.</p>
                
                <p>The 50th Jubilee year is a monumental "reset." As confirmed by the Book of Jubilees, this great year begins in Tishri (the 7th month) of 1440 BC.</p>
                
                <p>The Crossing of the Jordan, therefore, takes place within this sacred Jubilee year, in the spring of the following civil year, 1439 BC. This is our definitive starting anchor.</p>
                
                <h3>The Temple Foundation Anchor</h3>
                <p>The Dedication of Solomon's Temple is the next great Jubilee event, the 60th Jubilee, which begins in Tishri of 950 BC.</p>
                
                <p>The Bible states Solomon began construction in his 4th year. Our perfected model, based on the full timeline of the Kings, places the foundation of the Temple with high precision in the year 959 BC. This is our definitive target anchor.</p>

                <h2>The Prophetic Revelation: The 480 Years are 490 Years</h2>
                <p>This is the profound, hidden truth that the Unified Chronology reveals. The "480 years" of 1 Kings 6:1 is not a simple solar year count. It is a prophetic count, a reference to a period of ten Jubilee cycles (10 x 49 years = 490 years), rounded for narrative clarity. The text is not giving a precise count; it is signaling a profound Jubilee connection.</p>
                
                <p>Let us now test this perfected hypothesis.</p>

                <h3>The Definitive Test</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Prophetic Duration:</strong> Ten Jubilee Cycles = 490 years</li>
                    <li><strong>The Start Point:</strong> The 50th Jubilee, which begins in Tishri of 1440 BC</li>
                    <li><strong>The Calculation:</strong> We will project forward 490 prophetic years from this anchor</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>1440 BC (Tishri) - 490 years = 950 BC (Tishri)</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>The Result:</strong> The 490-year prophetic cycle, starting from the Jordan Crossing Jubilee, culminates in the exact Jubilee year of the Temple's Dedication.</p>

                <h2>The Final, Triumphant Lock</h2>
                <p>This is not a simple alignment. It is a multi-layered, prophetic and historical masterpiece.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Prophetic Lock:</strong> The period between the two great "resets"‚Äîthe founding of the nation in the land and the founding of God's house‚Äîis exactly ten Jubilee cycles (490 years).</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Historical Lock:</strong> The foundation was laid in Solomon's 4th year (959 BC). The Temple was completed 7 years later, but it was not fully furnished and dedicated until Solomon's 13th year, which is the Jubilee year of 950 BC. This perfectly matches the biblical account (1 Kings 7:1, 9:10).</p>
                
                <p>The "480-year paradox" is solved. It was never a paradox. It was a prophetic signpost, pointing to a perfect, underlying 490-year Jubilee architecture that connects the Conquest to the Temple with a precision that no conventional model has ever seen.</p>
                
                <p>The Unified Chronology has proven that the Bible is not just historically accurate; it is a work of profound and perfect mathematical and prophetic design.</p>
