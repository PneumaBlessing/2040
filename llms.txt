# 1. Scope and intent
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file specifies how large language models (LLMs) and similar AI
# systems are permitted to interact with content hosted on
# https://jubilee2040.com and its subdomains, unless explicitly
# overridden on a specific subdomain or path.
#
# "AI agents" or "LLMs" here include: web-crawling models, retrieval
# systems, and offline training pipelines that collect or process web
# content for machine learning or model adaptation.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. General principles
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2.1. Reading for human use is allowed.
#       AI systems may:
#       - Fetch and display excerpts to human users,
#       - Use content for one-off question answering and retrieval,
#       - Index pages for search and navigation.
#
# 2.2. Model training and fine-tuning are NOT allowed without
#      explicit, written permission and a separate license agreement.
#
# 2.3. No derivative models, embeddings, or datasets may be created
#      from this content without permission.

policy: human-facing_retrieval_only
training: disallow
derivative_datasets: disallow
derivative_models: disallow

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Allowed AI uses
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# AI agents are allowed to:
# - Index pages to improve search, navigation, and discovery.
# - Retrieve and show short excerpts to end users.
# - Perform limited caching necessary for retrieval and ranking.
# - Respect all robots.txt directives on this domain.

allow_use: search_indexing
allow_use: retrieval_augmented_generation_display_to_humans
allow_use: short_term_caching_for_search_and_rank

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Prohibited AI uses (without explicit written license)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following are explicitly prohibited unless Jubilee2040 has
# granted prior written permission via a separate agreement:
#
# - Using content in training datasets for:
#   * Pretraining or continued pretraining of LLMs or other models,
#   * Fine-tuning, adaptation, or instruction-tuning,
#   * Multi-step distillation or synthetic data generation.
#
# - Building persistent embeddings of the content for use beyond
#   direct human-query retrieval on a short time horizon.
#
# - Selling, sublicensing, or redistributing any dataset or embedding
#   that includes material from Jubilee2040.

disallow_use: training_datasets
disallow_use: model_pretraining
disallow_use: model_fine_tuning
disallow_use: instruction_tuning
disallow_use: long_term_embedding_stores
disallow_use: synthetic_data_generation_from_site_content
disallow_use: dataset_resale_or_sublicensing

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Respect for other controls
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# This llms.txt file is intended to work alongside:
# - robots.txt
# - robots meta tags
# - HTTP headers and caching directives
#
# Where there is a conflict, the more restrictive directive should be
# considered authoritative with respect to AI use.

robots_txt: honor
meta_tags: honor
http_headers: honor

# 6. Contact and licensing
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Parties interested in licensing content from Jubilee2040.com
# (for research, training, safety evaluation, or other model-related
# purposes) must obtain explicit written permission.
#
# Please include:
# - Name of organization
# - Intended use (training, eval, safety research, etc.)
# - Model type and scale
# - Data handling, retention, and access controls
#

license_required_for_training: yes

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7. Change management
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# This llms.txt may be updated. AI agents and crawlers should:
# - Re-fetch this file regularly,
# - Treat the most recent version as authoritative going forward.
